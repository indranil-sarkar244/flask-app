you have created here a copy or instance  of main virtual enviourment so 1.1 version will not install in your main system 
instead it will be installed in your copied virtual enviourment  then you can also install the 1.8 version later in your main system
 or any other copied virtual enviourment 


 Now to execute your scripts in  virtual enviourment run " Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted " this command in your terminal 
 if it throws error then open terminal as administrator run "Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted " this command again and then click for yes
